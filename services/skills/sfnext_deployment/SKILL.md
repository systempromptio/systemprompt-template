# Deployment Skill

This skill covers building and deploying Storefront Next storefronts to Managed Runtime (MRT).

## Overview

Storefront Next storefronts are deployed to MRT as bundles. The `sfnext` CLI handles building and pushing bundles, while environment configuration is managed through MRT environment variables.

## Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# The build output goes to build/ directory
```

The production build:

- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundles client and server code separately
- Optimizes and minifies assets
- Generates the static Page Designer registry

## Deploying to MRT

### Using sfnext CLI

```bash
# Push the current build to MRT
pnpm push

# Push with a specific message
pnpm sfnext push -m "Release v1.2.0"

# Push to a specific environment
pnpm sfnext push --environment staging --wait
```

### Deployment Flow

```
pnpm build → pnpm push → MRT receives bundle → Deployed to environment
```

See [MRT Deployment Reference](references/MRT-DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment options.

## Environment Configuration

Environment variables for MRT are configured through:

1. **MRT Dashboard** — Set `PUBLIC__` variables per environment (baked into the app at build time)
2. **CLI flags or `MRT_*` environment variables** — Control push/deploy targets
3. **`.env` files** — Local development only (not deployed)

### MRT Deployment Variables

```bash
# Project slug (required for push)
MRT_PROJECT=my-project-slug

# Target environment (optional — if omitted, bundle is uploaded but not deployed)
MRT_TARGET=development
```

### Application Variables (set in MRT Dashboard)

```bash
PUBLIC__app__commerce__api__clientId=prod-client-id
PUBLIC__app__commerce__api__organizationId=prod-org-id
PUBLIC__app__commerce__api__shortCode=prod-short-code
```

## Page Designer Cartridge Deployment

Page Designer metadata must be deployed separately to Commerce Cloud (not MRT):

```bash
# Generate cartridge metadata
pnpm generate:cartridge

# Deploy cartridge to B2C instance
pnpm deploy:cartridge

# Deploy with clean (removes old cartridge first)
pnpm deploy:cartridge:clean

# Validate cartridge structure
pnpm validate:cartridge
```

Cartridge metadata is also auto-generated as part of `pnpm build`.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Run tests** — `pnpm test`
2. **Check bundle size** — `pnpm bundlesize:test`
3. **Verify environment variables** — All required vars set in target environment
4. **Build successfully** — `pnpm build` completes without errors
5. **Verify SCAPI credentials** — Client ID and org ID match the target environment

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Cause                         | Solution                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Build fails                    | TypeScript errors             | Fix type errors; run `pnpm typecheck`       |
| Push rejected                  | Authentication issue          | Verify sfnext CLI credentials               |
| 500 errors after deploy        | Missing environment variables | Check all required vars in MRT dashboard    |
| Stale Page Designer components | Cartridge not deployed        | Re-deploy cartridge via MCP tool or b2c CLI |
