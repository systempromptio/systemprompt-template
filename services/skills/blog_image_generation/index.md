# Blog Featured Image Generation

Generate striking, impactful featured images for blog posts optimized for social media engagement.

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER include text** - No words, letters, numbers, or symbols that represent text. Image generation models struggle with text and it looks unprofessional.

2. **Optimize for impact** - Bold, attention-grabbing visuals that stop the scroll on social media feeds.

3. **Creative and satirical** - Editorial illustration meets modern meme culture. Think New Yorker cartoons, political satire, visual metaphors.

## Style Guidelines

- **Bold compositions** - Strong visual hierarchy, clear focal point
- **High contrast** - Works well as thumbnails and in dark/light mode
- **Conceptual** - Visual metaphors over literal representations
- **Satirical edge** - Gentle mockery of tech industry tropes when appropriate
- **Modern aesthetic** - Clean but not sterile, polished but not corporate

## What Works

- Visual metaphors (house of cards for fragile systems, puppet strings for control)
- Satirical takes on tech culture (developer stereotypes, startup tropes)
- Abstract representations of technical concepts
- Dramatic lighting and composition
- Unexpected juxtapositions

## What to Avoid

- Generic stock photo aesthetics
- Literal representations (showing actual code, laptops)
- Busy compositions that don't thumbnail well
- Safe, corporate, forgettable imagery
- Any text, labels, or captions in the image

## Prompt Structure

When generating image prompts, structure as:

```
[Visual concept/metaphor] for blog post about [topic].
Style: [specific artistic direction].
CRITICAL: No text, words, letters, or numbers in the image.
Mood: [emotional tone].
Composition: [framing guidance].
```

## Examples

**Topic:** AI agents failing in production
**Prompt:** A gleaming robot in a suit confidently walking off a cliff edge, other robots following behind. Editorial illustration style, dramatic perspective looking up at the cliff. CRITICAL: No text, words, letters, or numbers in the image. Mood: darkly humorous, cautionary. Bold colours, stark shadows.

**Topic:** Cost optimization in AI
**Prompt:** A person carefully balancing on a tightrope made of dollar bills stretched between two cloud formations, with gold coins raining down. Satirical New Yorker cartoon style. CRITICAL: No text, words, letters, or numbers in the image. Mood: precarious but determined. Clean composition with strong central focus.

**Topic:** God agents vs modular architecture
**Prompt:** A massive octopus with tangled tentacles trying to do everything at once, while nearby a coordinated school of small fish moves efficiently in formation. Surrealist editorial style. CRITICAL: No text, words, letters, or numbers in the image. Mood: chaotic vs elegant contrast. Split composition showing both approaches.
