# dw.util.PropertyComparator

## Overview
Comparator for sorting collections based on object properties, supporting ascending/descending order and custom attribute references.

## Description
This comparator can be used for the List sort() methods and for the SortSet and SortedMap classes. The comparator can be used to make a comparison based on a property of the contained objects. The Comparison is done based on the natural order of the values. It is guaranteed to work for Numbers, Strings, Dates, Money and Quantity values.

```ts
declare class PropertyComparator  {
  /**
   * Constructs the comparator from the variable length argument list. The parameters are property names that are to be used for the comparison. When comparing two objects, the comparator first compares them by the first property. If the two objects have equal values for the first property, the comparator then compares them by the second property, etc, until one object is determined to be less than the other or they are equal. Each parameter must be either a simple name like "totalSum" or can be a reference to a custom attribute like "custom.mytotal". Each parameter may also be prefixed with an optional '+' or '-' character to indicate that the objects should be sorted ascending or descending respectively by that property. If not specified for a given property then '+' (ascending sort) is assumed. For example: new PropertyComparator("+prop1", "-prop2", "prop3") constructs a Comparator which sorts by prop1 ascending, prop2 descending, and finally prop3 ascending. The comparator created with this constructor treats null values as greater than any other value.
   * @param property - The property name to compare by first.
   * @param otherProperties - Additional property names to sort by if two objects have the same values for the first property.
   */
  constructor(property: string, ...otherProperties: string[])

  /**
   * Constructs the comparator. The specified parameter is the name of the property that is used for the comparison. The parameter must be either a simple name like "totalSum" or can be a reference to a custom attribute like "custom.mytotal". The comparator created with this constructor is setup with ascending or descending sort order depending on value of sortOrder and null values being greater than any other value.
   * @param propertyName - the name of the property that is used for the comparison.
   * @param sortOrder - the sort order to use where true means ascending and false means descending.

   * @param arg2 - the second object to compare.
