faq:
  title: "Frequently asked questions"
  items:
    - question: "What's the difference between systemprompt.io and Claude/ChatGPT?"
      answer: "Claude and ChatGPT are AI models. systemprompt.io is a Rust framework for deploying AI to production. It provides auth, MCP hosting, agent orchestration, and observability in a single binary. You call the AI; we handle the infrastructure."
    - question: "Can I self-host everything?"
      answer: "Yes. systemprompt.io compiles to a single binary. Point it at any PostgreSQL database and run it on bare metal, in a VM, or containerized. The self-hosted version includes all core features. Cloud hosting is available for teams who want managed infrastructure."
    - question: "What MCP clients are supported?"
      answer: "Any MCP client works with systemprompt.io: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, and any tool that speaks the Model Context Protocol. Our servers use HTTP-native transports supported by modern clients."
    - question: "How does authentication work?"
      answer: "systemprompt.io uses OAuth2/OIDC for API authentication and WebAuthn for passwordless user login. Every MCP tool call and agent interaction is authenticated and authorized against scoped permissions."
    - question: "Is this open source?"
      answer: "systemprompt.io is source-available under BSL-1.1 (Business Source License). You can view, modify, and self-host the code. After 4 years, each version converts to Apache 2.0. The template you customize is MIT licensed and fully yours."
