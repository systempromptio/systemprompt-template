    title: "One Registry. Every Agent."
    content: |
      <p>Start your platform and immediately discover everything. <code>GET /api/v1/agents/registry</code> returns every agent with full A2A-compatible AgentCards. <code>GET /api/v1/mcp/registry</code> lists every MCP server with endpoints. No configuration discovery. No service mesh overhead.</p>
      <p>Each agent exposes its capabilities, security requirements, and MCP tool access through standard discovery endpoints. The registry is the source of truth—agents register at startup, clients discover at runtime.</p>
      <p>Well-known endpoints (<code>/.well-known/agent-cards</code>) follow the A2A protocol specification. Any A2A-compatible client can discover and connect to your agent mesh without custom integration.</p>

    title: "Agent-to-Agent. Native."
    content: |
      <p>A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol is built in, not bolted on. JSON-RPC 2.0 with methods for <code>message/send</code>, <code>message/stream</code>, <code>tasks/get</code>, and push notifications. Every agent speaks the same language—no translation layers.</p>
      <p>Internal agents communicate with external agents seamlessly. Your blog agent can query your analytics agent. Your content agent can delegate to your image generation agent. Mesh topology, not hub-and-spoke.</p>
      <p>Streaming responses, task management, and context persistence are protocol-native. Build multi-agent workflows without inventing coordination primitives.</p>

  - id: "authenticate-once"
    title: "One Token. Every Agent."
    content: |
      <p>Authenticate once at the mesh edge. Your OAuth2 token grants access to agents based on scopes—no per-agent authentication dance. The mesh enforces permissions uniformly across every agent and every MCP tool.</p>
      <p>Security schemes are declared per-agent: OAuth2 with PKCE, API keys, or custom schemes. The registry advertises requirements; clients negotiate at connection time. AgentCards include full security scheme definitions.</p>
      <p>User isolation is automatic. User A's token only accesses User A's agent contexts. Same mesh, complete separation. Audit trails capture every authenticated interaction.</p>

    title: "Agents Own the Domain."
    content: |
      <p>Unlike traditional APIs that expose narrow endpoints, agents have full access to state and the systemprompt domain. File storage, content management, user data, analytics—agents query and mutate the complete platform state.</p>
      <p>MCP tools are first-class: <code>database</code>, <code>files</code>, <code>content</code>, <code>users</code>. Agents don't call REST endpoints—they invoke tools with rich type safety and automatic permission enforcement.</p>
      <p>This is the "next generation API": instead of crafting request/response pairs, clients send natural language to agents who understand the full context and have the tools to act on it.</p>

      <p>Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, any MCP client—they all connect to your mesh. HTTP-native transports (<code>streamable-http</code>) work with modern MCP implementations. Point and connect.</p>
      <p>External AI providers become first-class mesh participants. Claude Code authenticates, discovers your agents via the registry, and starts sending A2A messages. Same protocol internal agents use.</p>
      <p>Your mesh is your API. External integrations query agents instead of building bespoke REST clients. The AI handles the interface—you provide the domain and tools.</p>
