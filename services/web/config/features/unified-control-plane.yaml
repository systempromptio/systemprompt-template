    title: "Agents and Humans. Same Interface."
    content: |
      <p>Claude Code, GPT-4 agents, and your custom AI all use this same CLI to manage production systems. Every command returns structured JSON. Every error includes actionable codes. Every operation is auditable.</p>
      <p>When a superagent runs <code>systemprompt infra services restart web</code>, it gets the same result you do. Same permissions. Same audit trail. Same interface on your laptop or a remote node.</p>
      <p>Self-documenting commands mean agents discover capabilities at runtime. <code>systemprompt --help --json</code> returns complete API schemas. No hard-coded integrations required.</p>

    title: "Local to Remote in One Command"
    content: |
      <p>Your local CLI is a secure gateway to any SystemPrompt node. Switch profiles and every command routes transparently to the target environment. No SSH. No VPN. No credential juggling.</p>
      <p><code>systemprompt cloud profile use production</code> switches your entire session to remote execution. Inspect logs, restart services, rebuild agents—all from your local terminal with full audit visibility.</p>
      <p>Authentication flows automatically. OAuth tokens refresh silently. The CLI handles credential rotation so you never touch secrets directly. Secure-by-default for AI infrastructure.</p>

    title: "Eight Domains. Your Entire Stack."
    content: |
      <p>Eight domains cover everything: <code>core</code> for content and capabilities, <code>infra</code> for services and databases, <code>admin</code> for users and agents, <code>cloud</code> for deployment, <code>analytics</code> for metrics, <code>web</code> for frontend, <code>plugins</code> for MCP servers, <code>build</code> for compilation.</p>
      <p>This is the control plane architecture. Each domain maps to a capability boundary. Permissions scope to domains. Audit logs categorize by domain. Think in domains, operate in domains.</p>
      <p>A2A protocol support means agents coordinate via <code>systemprompt admin agents message</code>. MCP tools execute via <code>systemprompt plugins mcp tools</code>. The CLI is the unified surface for your entire AI mesh.</p>

    title: "Every Operation. Full Audit Trail."
    content: |
      <p>Every command streams structured output to stdout. Every operation logs to the audit trail. Compose pipelines that transform data AND maintain complete operational visibility.</p>
      <p><code>systemprompt infra logs audit --request-id abc123</code> traces any operation across services. See exactly what your AI infrastructure executed, when, and with what result.</p>
      <p>Request inspection, tool execution logging, and agent message tracing are first-class operations. Debug production issues without leaving your terminal. The audit trail is always there.</p>

    title: "YAML Changes Deploy Instantly"
    content: |
      <p>YAML changes deploy instantly. Update an agent configuration, run <code>systemprompt admin agents sync</code>, and the change is live. Rebuild content with <code>systemprompt core content publish</code>. No code deploys for configuration changes.</p>
      <p>Regenerate agents, restart services, republish content, sync MCP servers—all via CLI. CI/CD pipelines orchestrate with standard shell scripts. Idempotent operations mean safe retries.</p>
      <p>Your AI superagent executes these same operations. Claude Code running your deploy script operates production with the same tooling you use. One harness for humans and agents alike.</p>
