    title: "Everything in 50MB"
    content: |
      <p>One <code>cargo build --release</code> produces a 50MB binary containing everything: OAuth2 authorization server, WebAuthn authentication, MCP host, agent orchestrator, scheduler, file storage, content management, and analytics. No sidecars. No orchestration. No runtime dependencies.</p>
      <p>What other platforms require you to wire together—auth service, job runner, file storage, observability stack—SystemPrompt includes. Copy the binary to any Linux server and run it. Millisecond startup. No JIT warmup. No interpreter initialization.</p>
      <p>Static linking means zero runtime dependencies. Predictable deployment footprint. The same binary runs in Docker, on bare metal, or in your cloud VM. One artifact. Every environment.</p>

    content: |
      <p>Most AI demos fail at "now add users." SystemPrompt ships with a complete OAuth2/OIDC authorization server and WebAuthn passwordless authentication. Not "bring your own Clerk." Not "integrate Auth0." Built in.</p>
      <p>PKCE authorization code flows. Client credentials for service-to-service. Token introspection. Standard OIDC discovery at <code>/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>. Every MCP tool call, every agent interaction is authenticated and authorized against scoped permissions.</p>
      <p>Per-user, per-agent, per-tool scopes enforced at every layer. User isolation is automatic—User A cannot access User B's agents, files, or data. Memory-safe credential handling with no buffer overflow vulnerabilities in your auth stack.</p>

    title: "MCP That Works in Production"
    content: |
      <p>Most MCP servers run on localhost with no authentication. That works for demos. SystemPrompt hosts MCP over HTTP with real OAuth2 protection—the same MCP servers, production-ready from day one.</p>
      <p>Per-tool OAuth2 scopes give you granular permission control. The <code>content:write</code> tool requires the <code>content:write</code> scope. The <code>admin:users</code> tool requires <code>admin</code>. Tenant isolation is automatic—User A's Claude Code only sees User A's data.</p>
      <p>Works immediately with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, and any MCP client. HTTP-native transport. Full audit trail of every tool call: who invoked what, when, with what parameters, what result. Tokio's async runtime handles thousands of concurrent tool calls efficiently.</p>

      <p>SystemPrompt is a Cargo dependency, not a platform. Add <code>systemprompt = "x.x"</code> to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>, implement extension traits, compile. You own the resulting binary. We never see your code.</p>
      <p>Extension traits for everything: <code>ApiExtension</code> adds HTTP routes with full Axum power. <code>SchemaExtension</code> adds database tables with migrations. <code>JobExtension</code> adds background jobs. <code>ProviderExtension</code> adds custom LLM providers. Type-safe interfaces—if it compiles, it works.</p>
      <p>Compile-time discovery via the <code>inventory</code> crate. No runtime reflection. Zero-cost trait abstractions. Pin your SystemPrompt version. Update when YOU decide. Ship YOUR product with YOUR proprietary logic on an open core.</p>

      <p>Cost tracking and audit trails are compliance requirements, not nice-to-haves. SystemPrompt captures everything automatically—no instrumentation code, no custom logging, no third-party observability stack to deploy.</p>
      <p>Every AI request logged: tokens in, tokens out, cost estimate, latency, model, user, agent. Every tool call audited: permissions checked, execution time, result status. Query via CLI: <code>systemprompt analytics costs --by model</code>, <code>systemprompt infra logs --level error</code>.</p>
      <p>Compliance-ready exports for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA. Debug any agent session end-to-end. Catch cost anomalies before the invoice arrives. Structured tracing via the <code>tracing</code> crate. Async-aware logging with zero runtime overhead.</p>
