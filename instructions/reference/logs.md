# Log Querying

Query application logs stored in the PostgreSQL `logs` table.

## Table Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | text | Unique log entry ID |
| `timestamp` | timestamp | When the log was created |
| `level` | varchar | Log level: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| `module` | varchar | Source module (e.g., `ai`, `mcp_task`, `analytics`) |
| `message` | text | Log message content |
| `metadata` | text | JSON metadata (nullable) |
| `user_id` | varchar | Associated user ID (nullable) |
| `session_id` | varchar | Session ID (nullable) |
| `task_id` | varchar | A2A Task ID (nullable) |
| `trace_id` | varchar | Trace ID for distributed tracing (nullable) |
| `context_id` | varchar | A2A Context ID (nullable) |
| `client_id` | varchar | Client identifier (nullable) |

## Commands

### Basic Query

```bash
just query "SQL_STATEMENT" [FORMAT]
```

Formats: `table` (default), `json`, `csv`

### Alternative (direct binary)

```bash
target/debug/systemprompt-server db query "SQL_STATEMENT"
target/debug/systemprompt-server db query "SQL_STATEMENT" --format json
```

## Common Queries

### Recent Errors

```bash
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, message FROM logs WHERE level = 'ERROR' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 20"
```

### Errors by Module

```bash
just query "SELECT timestamp, message, task_id, context_id FROM logs WHERE level = 'ERROR' AND module = 'ai' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### Filter by Task ID

Task IDs are UUIDs. Use exact match or partial match with LIKE:

```bash
# Exact match
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, message FROM logs WHERE task_id = '08a90adb-f686-4029-bdaf-62049f662566' ORDER BY timestamp"

# Partial match (first 8 chars)
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, message, context_id FROM logs WHERE task_id LIKE '%08a90adb%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC"
```

### Filter by Context ID

```bash
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, message FROM logs WHERE context_id = '0822f708-6b42-45f6-9317-81b25a6166d9' ORDER BY timestamp"
```

### Find Task and Context IDs

```bash
# List distinct task IDs
just query "SELECT DISTINCT task_id FROM logs WHERE task_id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY task_id LIMIT 20"

# Find task ID by partial match
just query "SELECT DISTINCT task_id FROM logs WHERE task_id LIKE '%08a90adb%'"

# Recent logs with task IDs
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, task_id, context_id FROM logs WHERE task_id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### All Logs for a Task

```bash
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, context_id, SUBSTRING(message, 1, 200) as msg FROM logs WHERE task_id = '08a90adb-f686-4029-bdaf-62049f662566' ORDER BY timestamp"
```

### Log Level Distribution

```bash
just query "SELECT level, COUNT(*) as count FROM logs GROUP BY level ORDER BY count DESC"
```

### Logs by Time Range

```bash
just query "SELECT timestamp, level, module, message FROM logs WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50"
```

### Module Activity

```bash
just query "SELECT module, COUNT(*) as count FROM logs GROUP BY module ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 20"
```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Table (default)
just query "SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT 5"

# JSON
just query "SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT 5" json

# CSV
just query "SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT 5" csv
```

## Tips

1. **Use SUBSTRING for long messages**: `SUBSTRING(message, 1, 200)` truncates to 200 chars
2. **Partial UUID matching**: Use `LIKE '%first8chars%'` when you only have part of a task/context ID
3. **Time-based filtering**: Use `NOW() - INTERVAL 'X hours/days'` for recent logs
4. **NULL handling**: Add `WHERE column IS NOT NULL` to filter out nulls
